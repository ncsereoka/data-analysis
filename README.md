### Analysis of Facebook messages

  I took a look at some of my conversations using this [notebook](https://github.com/ncsereoka/data-analysis/blob/master/FacebookMessagesAnalysis/FacebookAnalysis.ipynb).  
  You need to download your Facebook data (messages are enough, the zip file can get pretty big, especially if you or your friends enjoy sharing images).  
  After this, use the "message_1.json" files found in the folders with the names of your conversation partners for analysis.  
  For now, I only look at:

* word frequencies;
* the number of conversations started (the user that sends the first message after an interval gains an increment);
* average message length;
* average conversation length;
* average response time (within a given window);
* percentages of messages of the users (i.e. this participant sent x% of the messages in this convo).

  Any other ideas (or corrections) are welcome.
